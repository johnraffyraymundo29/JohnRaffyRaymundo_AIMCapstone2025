Introduction**\n","\n","Hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge are widely recognised as a key indicator of healthcare quality, continuity of care, and system efficiency. Unplanned readmissions are associated with increased healthcare costs, patient dissatisfaction, and avoidable clinical complications.\n","\n","In the Philippine healthcare context, where tertiary hospitals often operate under constrained resources and fragmented post-discharge follow-up systems, early identification of patients at high risk of readmission can enable targeted interventions and more efficient allocation of limited clinical resources.\n","\n","This notebook focuses on problem framing and data understanding, forming the foundation for subsequent data preprocessing, modelling, and evaluation steps."],"metadata":{"id":"KmRi2bbI57jU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**2. Business Problem**\n","\n","Hospitals face challenges in identifying patients who are likely to be readmitted shortly after discharge. Without early risk stratification, post-discharge interventions are often applied uniformly or reactively, leading to inefficient use of clinical staff and avoidable readmissions.\n","\n","**Business Objective:**\n","\n","To identify patients at high risk of 30-day hospital readmission at the point of discharge.\n","\n","Accurate identification of high-risk patients enables hospitals to prioritise post-discharge interventions such as follow-up calls, medication reconciliation, outpatient referrals, and care coordination, ultimately reducing readmission rates and associated costs."],"metadata":{"id":"KxDzvwzZkxYc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**3.
